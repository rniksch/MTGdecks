== Deck Name
Angel


== Concept:
Much like having a dragon of big green heavy hitter deck I had a lot of angels and thought it would be interesting to see how many could get onto the table at the same time.

The Blinding angel is super fun , more so if you get two out.

This deck takes a while to get going and does not hold up well against fast weenie decks. 

Aether viles are helpful in getting the larger creatures out.
