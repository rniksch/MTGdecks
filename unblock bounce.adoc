== Deck Name
unblock bounce


== Concept:
I idea of constantly being able to return things to peoples hands seem a great way to frustrate friends. To make things worse having unblockable attacks seeded even more fun.

My stop at blouncing things back to hand, so I added warped devotion to force a discard as well.
