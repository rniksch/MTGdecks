== Deck Name
Elf Deck



== Concept:
AT the time this deck was build I had a massive collection of older cards. To the point that the builder of this deck took on a bit of challenge. He would build a deck without looking at anything I have. Then pass the list to me to see if I could fulfill the deck requirements out of my collection. 

This was one of those decks and I was able to put together the entire deck.

This is the deck which created the blind hatred for elves.
Call of the wild cycling through the deck and library simply putting elves into play for free. Gaeas blessing not meant to ever be played but instead milled as part of the call of the wild process and returning the graveyard to hand.
