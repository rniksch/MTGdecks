Card Text:
At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have 200 or more cards in your library, you win the game.  This started as a way of being a pain in the ass. If you are going to have a massive 300+ card deck, I would like to see you shuffle that beast. So I started working on a deck which would force people to shuffle. That later evolved into could I deal damage as a result of shuffling?
