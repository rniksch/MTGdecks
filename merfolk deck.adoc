== Deck Name
merfolk deck



== Concept:
AT the time this deck was build I had a massive collection of older cards. To the point that the builder of this deck took on a bit of challenge. He would build a deck without looking at anything I have. Then pass the list to me to see if I could fulfill the deck requirements out of my collection. 

This was one of those decks and I was able to put together the entire deck.

very fun to play, flood and seas claim and fountain killing off other players land and provising an unblock for your attacks.
