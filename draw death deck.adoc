== Deck Name
draw death deck



== Concept:
Still one of my favorite decks to play.

could you deal damage in each phase for simply playing magic.
could you punish someone for drawing a card, discarding a card, having cards in hand. 

Yes again I just wanted to be an Arse and use someone of the older cards I had.

Creates are only there to hold attackers at bay.
