== Deck Name
black red first deck



== Concept:
Very first deck I every build, friend of mine got a booster box of planscape. I spapped together a deck out of mainly commons. it resulted in an intersting mix of discard and destroy creature.

added a few cards over the years but I am still impressed at this as my first deck.
