== Deck Name
Mine


== Concept:
There is no getting around this, I simply wanted to be an areshole, the most hated player. This deck is fantasitic in a multipler game where you can sit back of the bus unnoticed while other players wail on each other until it is too late. Once it gets going it has the ability to frustrate other players to the extreme.
